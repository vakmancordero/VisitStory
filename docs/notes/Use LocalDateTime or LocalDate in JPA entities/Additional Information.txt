Question:

In my case, the LocalDateTime and LocalDate persisted even without using the hibernate-java8 dependency. I am using the Spring-data-jpa and hibernate as it’s implementation. Is it handled by Spring?

Answer:

Yes, Spring Data JPA provides a set of AttributeConverter to handle the classes of the Date and Time API. That’s the same approach as I explained here: How to persist LocalDate and LocalDateTime with JPA
