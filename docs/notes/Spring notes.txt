Spring notes:

1. Use LocalDateTime or LocalDate in JPA entities

You can implement a JPA AttributeConverter and convert the Java 8 class into one that is supported by Hibernate. 

This approach does not use any Hibernate-specific APIs and is portable to other JPA implementations but it is a little complicated.

Or you can use the Hibernate-specific Java 8 support which was introduced with Hibernate 5. This approach is not portable to other JPA implementations but much easier to use as I will show you in this post.
